# Vehicle Price Prediction App

A machine learning–powered web application built using Streamlit that predicts the price of a vehicle based on its specifications.
This project uses a custom-trained regression model and a clean UI for real-time predictions.

## Overview

This app allows users to enter vehicle attributes such as make, model, fuel type, body style, transmission, mileage, turbo, fuel system, and more — and receive an instant predicted price.

The ML model is trained using a cleaned dataset with engineered features and preprocessing
